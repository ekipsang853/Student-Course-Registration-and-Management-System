# 📘 Student Course Registration and Management System

---

## 📌 Project Description

The **Student Course Registration and Management System** is a web-based application developed using Spring Boot. It is designed to help universities manage student records, course information, and course registrations efficiently.

The system allows administrators to manage students and courses, while enabling students to register and drop courses. It follows the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture and integrates with a **MySQL database** for persistent data storage.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The application follows the **Spring Boot MVC architecture**:

* **Model Layer**: Represents database entities (`Student`, `Course`, `Registration`)
* **View Layer**: Thymeleaf templates (HTML pages)
* **Controller Layer**: Handles HTTP requests
* **Service Layer**: Contains business logic
* **Repository Layer**: Handles database operations using Spring Data JPA

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Java
* Spring Boot
* Spring MVC
* Spring Data JPA
* Thymeleaf
* MySQL Database
* Maven
* HTML/CSS
* Bootstrap

---

## 🗄️ Database Design

The system uses three main tables:

### 1. Student

* StudentID (Primary Key)
* Name
* Email

### 2. Course

* CourseID (Primary Key)
* Title
* Credits

### 3. Registration

* RegistrationID (Primary Key)
* StudentID (Foreign Key)
* CourseID (Foreign Key)
* RegisteredAt
* Status
* Grade
* Term
* Section

📌 A many-to-many relationship exists between Student and Course, resolved using the Registration table.
